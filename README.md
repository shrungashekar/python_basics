🐍 Python Basics

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This project contains simple programs that demonstrate basic Python concepts. I'm currently exploring how to check whether a number is even or odd using different approaches.

📂 Contents

even_odd_function.py – Checks if a number is even or odd using a function.

loops.py – Checks if a number is even or odd using a loop.

🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my journey to learn Python programming. It focuses on:

Understanding control flow with loops

Writing reusable code using functions

Practicing basic input/output operations

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shrungashekar/python_basics.git
cd python_basics

Run the scripts:

python even_odd_function.py
python loops.py

💡 What's Next

I'll be adding more beginner-friendly Python programs soon, including:

Conditional statements

Lists and dictionaries

Basic file handling
Feel free to contribute and suggest improvements!
